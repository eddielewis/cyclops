The current QR codes in use are 20mm square, a improvement to 10mm would be a nice improvement if possible. The head speed at the moment is 300mm per second. The rolling shutter of the cameras might be a problem for accuracy, though the head could be stopped at intervals if this is a problem.

The use of UV invisible ink for the QR codes is a possibility.

If required, an encoder pulse can be given to the Pis. The pulse would fire 10,000 times per mm.
